## Competition Overview

The National Cyber League (NCL) is a biannual cybersecurity competition where students compete in a variety of security challenges. The Spring 2025 season brought together over 5,000 participants from universities and high schools across the country.

## My Performance

I'm proud to have achieved a **Top 10% ranking** in the individual competition, placing in the top 500 competitors nationwide. This represented significant growth from my previous participation.

### Challenge Categories

The competition consisted of several categories:

1. **Cryptography** - My strongest area, solving 12/15 challenges
2. **Web Application Exploitation** - Found and exploited XSS, SQLi, and CSRF vulnerabilities
3. **Network Traffic Analysis** - Analyzed pcap files to identify malicious activity
4. **Password Cracking** - Used hashcat and custom wordlists
5. **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** - Gathered information from public sources
6. **Forensics** - Extracted and analyzed data from compromised systems

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills

- **Advanced Cryptanalysis:** Learned to identify and break various encryption schemes, including RSA with small exponents and simple substitution ciphers
- **Web Security:** Gained deeper understanding of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and how to exploit them ethically
- **Tool Proficiency:** Became comfortable with Burp Suite, Wireshark, John the Ripper, and various Python security libraries

### Problem-Solving Approach

One of my biggest takeaways was learning to **think like an attacker**. Instead of just knowing how systems should work, I learned to identify how they might fail. This defensive mindset is crucial for building secure systems.

## Memorable Challenge

My favorite challenge involved a multi-stage web exploitation scenario:

1. Found an SQL injection vulnerability in a login form
2. Extracted database credentials
3. Discovered an admin panel with file upload
4. Bypassed upload restrictions to gain code execution
5. Escalated privileges to capture the flag

What made this memorable wasn't just solving it, but the detective work involved—each step revealed a new clue about where to look next.

## Competition Strategy

Time management was crucial. I learned to:

- **Triage challenges** - Quickly identify which challenges matched my strengths
- **Take breaks** - Stepping away often led to breakthrough moments
- **Document everything** - Keeping notes helped when revisiting partial solutions
- **Ask for hints strategically** - Knowing when to spend more time vs. when to get unstuck

## Looking Forward

This competition reinforced my interest in cybersecurity and secure software development. I'm now:

- Studying for the Security+ certification
- Building a home security lab with intentionally vulnerable VMs
- Contributing to open-source security tools
- Planning to participate in more CTF competitions

The skills I've gained aren't just about finding vulnerabilities—they've made me a better developer who thinks about security from the ground up.
